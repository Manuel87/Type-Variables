# RobotoFlex
- demo to test the capabilities of the new fontformat
- work in progress

Preview in Fontview (https://github.com/googlei18n/fontview/releases)

## Features currently missing in the fontformat
- per-glyph-interpolation axes (sub axes are currently achieved by an workaround)
- math for the slider behaviour to increase usability (e.g. to make faux-mono-axis a child of mono-axis)
