Experimental Variable Fonts and a Framework, listing and sorting as many formal variables as possible.<br/>
[Work in progress]

- [Experimental Variable Fonts](http:vongebhardi.de/variable-fonts/testing/) (preview with interface, external)
  - Fonts and sources are available in the respective [folder](https://github.com/Manuel87/Type-Variables/tree/master/variable-typefaces)
  - UPDATE, they moved here: [RobotoFlex](https://github.com/Manuel87/RobotoFlex/), [CrimVarious](https://github.com/Manuel87/CrimVarious/), [TypedesignFramework](https://github.com/Manuel87/TypedesignFramework)

## My Personal Roadmap

### Soon
- [ ] Sharable GIF - making an awesome intro animation based on the animated icons (for sharing)
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Adding all the other local interpolations to the ttf
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Add Line-Height-Compensation axes (or make a separarte ttf)

### Eventually some time later
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Make Line-Height-Comensation axes a real top level axes (with javascript)
- [ ] Metapolation - Add slider interface within Glyphs
- [ ] Framework - rewrite it in YAML
- [ ] Framework - Feature - make it easy to add things
- [ ] Framework - Add more examples with descriptions
- [ ] Axis-Workflow-Feature - make it possible to easily export local interpolations to variable axes
- [ ] Code â€“ Make it easy to push variable fonts from github to the testing site
- [ ] (invite people to add examples)
- [ ] (HTML - maybe standard + expert mode)
- [ ] ...
