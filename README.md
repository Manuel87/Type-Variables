## Roadmap
.. still on the progress to finalize the Roadmap...

### For the first release (what I will think is necessary to do, to finish the job)

o Doc-Design/CODE - making the html design responsive
o Content -Paragraph about the UI challenges / eg. about slider (what is good, what bad.. 
o Misc - Various minor corrections (mark alternative Labels, four-letter-tags, ..)
o Code/HTML –  add proper gx-fonts with sliders - Implementing the Variable font files for all the examples (optimally there should be a load button (and a gif preview)
o Cleaning up
o Feature - Add possibility to view a paragraph with the available
o Icon-Design: revisit Curvature

### will do on my own costs (adding value but wasn’t specifically asked for)
---------------------------------
o Lecturing - revising the texts - (who to ask? -> John Hudson / Toshi / David Brezina / Kat / ..)
