Variable Font Experiments and a Framework, listing and sorting as many formal variables as possible. Work in progress.
- Main Document: [Variable Overview](http://vongebhardi.de/clients/google/typevariables/) (external preview)
- Latest Update: [Typedesign Framework](http://vongebhardi.de/clients/google/typevariables/typedesign-framework.html) (external)
- [As a GoogleDoc for lecturing the text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18m8dFZD638eCFxf4CTe1V-S0k2JuUR-Y3yxVfTv_AAc/edit) (bit messy duo copy/paste from HTML)

- Preview/test with sliders of the variable fonts: [Variable Font Testing](http:vongebhardi.de/clients/google/variable-font-testing/) (external, based on [axis-praxis.org](http://axis-praxis.org))
- Fonts and sources are available in the respective folder

## Roadmap

### For the first release (what I will think is necessary to do, to finish the job) - Until mid of May
- [x] GIT- adding all current fonts+sources (probably this weekend) 
- [x] Add all the necessary code and description for RobotoFlex
- [ ] Code/HTML – gx-fonts with sliders - Implementing the Variable font files for all the examples (optimally there should be a load button (and a gif as preview)
- [x] Icon-Design: revisit Curvature
- [x] Icon-Design: revisit Modulation
- [x] Icon-Design: revisit Free Forms
- [x] Added alternative Labels to top-level variables
- [ ] Feature - Add possibility to view a paragraph with the available characters
- [ ] Content – add short paragraphs for existing examples 
- [ ] Misc - Various minor corrections (mark alternative Labels, four-letter-tags, ..)
- [ ] Cleaning up

### Hopefully - Will do on my own costs (adding value but wasn’t specifically asked for)
- [ ] Lecturing - revising the texts - (who to ask? -> John Hudson / Toshi / David Brezina / Kat / ..) 
- [ ] Doc-Design-Banner - making a fancy intro animation based on the animated icons (also good for sharing)
- [ ] Doc-Design - making it more fun/special and functional
- [ ] Doc-Design/CODE - making the html design responsive
- [ ] Content - Paragraph about the UI challenges / eg. about slider (what is good, what bad..
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Adding all the other local interpolations to the File

### Next Round 
- [ ] HTML – rewrite it in YAML
- [ ] Feature - make it easy to add things
- [ ] Draw – improve/update the property-icons (curvature, modulation, free forms, contrast, optical size)
- [ ] Axis-Workflow-Feature - make it possible to easily export local interpolations to variable axes)
- [ ] Interface - make a proper web design
- [ ] Code – Make it easy to add examples
- [ ] Content – Add existing gx-fonts
- [ ] Draw – 5 more examples
- [ ] (maybe invite people to add examples)
- [ ] (HTML - maybe standard + expert mode)
- [ ] ...



### Done
---------------------------------
### What I have done the last weeks
- [x] GITHUB - upload ;)
- [x] Content – write/rewrite description for each top level variable
- [x] Content - Adding loads of sub-variables and possible settings (only textwise)
- [x] VF - Make my Roboto-Flex with at least 10axes work 
- [x] Visual - Correcting icons: Optical Size
- [x] -partially- Code – make my glyphs-gx-workflow work! (worked on it for 3 days ... seems too much work at the moment )
