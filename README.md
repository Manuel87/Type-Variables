## Roadmap

### For the first release (what I will think is necessary to do, to finish the job) - Until mid of May
- [x] GIT- adding all current fonts+sources (probably this weekend) 
- [x] Add all the necessary code and description for RobotoFlex
- [x] Code/HTML – gx-fonts with sliders - Implementing the Variable font files for all the examples (optimally there should be a load button (and a gif as preview) / more or less fulfilled
- [x] Icon-Design: revisit Curvature
- [x] Icon-Design: revisit Modulation
- [x] Icon-Design: revisit Free Forms
- [x] Added alternative Labels to top-level variables
- [x] Feature - Add possibility to view a paragraph with the available characters (namerecord 19 :)
- [x] Content – add short description for existing examples / more or less fulfilled
- [x] Misc - Various minor corrections (mark alternative Labels, four-letter-tags, ..)
- [x] RobotoFlex - adding building descriptions, etc.
- [x] Personal Cleaning up
- [ ] Incorporate corrections by Dave (naming, license, url, structure, way of mentioning google, ...)

### Hopefully - Will do on my own costs (adding value but wasn’t specifically asked for)
- [ ] Lecturing - revising the texts
- [ ] Doc-Design-Banner - making a fancy intro animation based on the animated icons (also good for sharing)
- [ ] Doc-Design - making it more fun/special and [x] functional
- [x] Doc-Design/CODE - making the html design responsive
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Adding all the other local interpolations to the ttf
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Add Line-Height-Compensation axes (or make a separarte ttf)

### Eventually Next Round 
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Make Line-Height-Comensation axes a real top level axes (with javascript)
- [ ] Metapolation - Add slider interface within glyphs
- [ ] HTML – rewrite it in YAML
- [ ] Feature - make it easy to add things
- [x] Draw – improve/update the property-icons (curvature, modulation, free forms, contrast, optical size)
- [ ] Axis-Workflow-Feature - make it possible to easily export local interpolations to variable axes)
- [ ] Interface - make a proper web design
- [ ] Code – Make it easy to add examples
- [ ] Content – Add existing gx-fonts
- [ ] Draw – 5 more examples
- [ ] Content - Paragraph about the facing UI challenges / eg. about slider (what is good, what bad..
- [ ] (maybe invite people to add examples)
- [ ] (HTML - maybe standard + expert mode)
- [ ] ...



### Done
---------------------------------
### What I have done the last weeks
- [x] GITHUB - upload ;)
- [x] Content – write/rewrite description for each top level variable
- [x] Content - Adding loads of sub-variables and possible settings (only textwise)
- [x] VF - Make my Roboto-Flex with at least 10axes work 
- [x] Visual - Correcting icons: Optical Size
- [x] -partially- Code – make my glyphs-gx-workflow work! (worked on it for 3 days ... seems too much work, at the moment )
