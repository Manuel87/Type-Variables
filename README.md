# Type-Variables
Variable Font Experiments, Framework and list of as many formal variables as possible.


## Roadmap
.. still on the progress to finalize the Roadmap...

### For the first release (what I will think is necessary to do, to finish the job)
-[ ] GIT- adding all current fonts+sources (probably this weekend) 
-o Doc-Design/CODE - making the html design responsive
-o Content -Paragraph about the UI challenges / eg. about slider (what is good, what bad.. 
o Misc - Various minor corrections (mark alternative Labels, four-letter-tags, ..)
o Code/HTML – gx-fonts with sliders - Implementing the Variable font files for all the examples (optimally there should be a load button (and a gif as preview)
o Cleaning up
o Feature - Add possibility to view a paragraph with the available characters
o Icon-Design: revisit Curvature
o Icon-Design: revisit Modulation
o Icon-Design: revisit Free Forms
o Content – add short paragraphs for existing examples

### Will do on my own costs (adding value but wasn’t specifically asked for)
o Lecturing - revising the texts - (who to ask? -> John Hudson / Toshi / David Brezina / Kat / ..) 
o Doc-Design-Banner - making a fancy intro animation based on the animated icons (also good for sharing)
o Doc-Design - making it more fun/special and functional

### Next Round 
o HTML – rewrite it in YAML
o Feature - make it easy to add things
o Draw – improve/update the property-icons (curvature, modulation, free forms, contrast, optical size)
o Axis-Workflow-Feature - make it possible to easily export local interpolations to variable axes)




o Interface - make a proper web design


o Code – Make it easy to add examples
o Content – Add existing gx-fonts
o Draw – 5 more examples
o (maybe invite people to add examples)
o (HTML - maybe standard + expert mode)

I’m sitting now at the typo labs :) 


### Done
---------------------------------
### What I have done the last weeks
x GITHUB - upload it
x Content – write/rewrite description for each top level variable
x Content - Adding loads of sub-variables and possible settings
x VF - Make the Roboto-Flex with at least 10axes work
x Visual - Correcting icons: Optical Size
~ Code – make my glyphs-gx-workflow work! (took too much time) 
-> partially -> need to work on it more.. for the moment it just needs to stay at it
