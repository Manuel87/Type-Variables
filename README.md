## My Personal Roadmap

### Soon
- [ ] Sharable GIF - making an awesome intro animation based on the animated icons (for sharing)
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Adding all the other local interpolations to the ttf
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Add Line-Height-Compensation axes (or make a separarte ttf)

### Eventually some time later
- [ ] RobotoFlex - Make Line-Height-Comensation axes a real top level axes (with javascript)
- [ ] Metapolation - Add slider interface within Glyphs
- [ ] Framework - rewrite it in YAML
- [ ] Framework - Feature - make it easy to add things
- [ ] Framework - Add more examples with descriptions
- [ ] Axis-Workflow-Feature - make it possible to easily export local interpolations to variable axes
- [ ] Code â€“ Make it easy to push variable fonts from github to the testing site
- [ ] (invite people to add examples)
- [ ] (HTML - maybe standard + expert mode)
- [ ] ...
